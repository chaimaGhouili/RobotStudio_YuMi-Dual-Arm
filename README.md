# Object Manipulation with Smart Gripper and Synchronous ABB Robotic Arms
## Project Introduction
This project features an automated system designed to sort cylinders by color using the IRB 14000 YuMi ABB robot. The system leverages a camera for real-time color detection through Python and utilizes RobotStudio for simulation and control, ensuring accurate sorting and placement of cylinders.
# Key Features

 * Automated Sorting Efficiently 
* Real-Time Color Detection
* Smart Gripper Integration
* cooperation of both robotic arms synchronously
